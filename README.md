# Path of Exile Economic Analysis (Springboard Capstone Project 1)
This project is a part of the Springboard Data Science Career track. Other assignment files and capstone project can be found in a separate repository.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
Path of Exile is a free-to-play Action RPG (i.e. Diablo 2/3 etc.) that utilizes player-to-player trading within their economy. However, as there is a distinct lack of any single monetary currency or a trading method (such as an auction house) within the game, associated worth of individual items is instead tied to a set of currency items that have rapid fluctuations throughout the league that depend on a multitude of factors. For this capstone project, I will analyze the time-series data sets aggregated from previous 3-month leagues (Incursion, Bestiary, Abyss, Harbinger, Legacy, Breach) that include both currency item values and unique item values to build a model that can be used in future leagues for calculated investments within the game economy.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
-- Random Forest
-- Deep Learning Neural Networks (Keras)
* Data Visualization
* Time Series Modeling
* Forecasting with ARIMA

## Project Description
With recent league launches of over 100,000 unique players, there are many people interested in growing their personal wealth within the game. However, due to the complex nature of this game, an ongoing issue for many players is that they shy away from making investments due to number of variables needed to consider to accurately price their individual loot found. Along with these players, there are also many players who use the game as a way to flip currency and high-priced unique items for the sole purpose of Real Money Trading (RMT) aka the act of selling in game currency for real world money. (Note: This is illegal within the gameâ€™s terms of service, but realistically has not been stopped). My goal is to provide an easy-to-understand model that all players can use to overcome the steep learning curve of the game in hopes of maximizing their personal profits.
